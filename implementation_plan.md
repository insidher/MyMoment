# Implementation Plan - Refine Room Layout

The goal is to improve the visual hierarchy and spacing in the Listening Room (`app/room/[id]/page.tsx`), specifically addressing the "crowded" feeling between the Saved Moments list and the Moment Details panel.

    - Open a Room with saved moments.
    - Verify that the "Saved Moments" list is inside a glass panel.
    - Verify that there is clear vertical spacing between the Player/Title and the Saved Moments panel.
    - Verify that the Right Column (Controls) is visually distinct and separated by the grid gap.
